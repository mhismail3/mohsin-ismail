The web is fundamentally built on hyperlinks—those clickable bridges that connect ideas, resources, and people across the digital landscape. Here's how they look in my posts.

## Inline Links in Action

When I'm writing about something like [React](https://react.dev) or referencing [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org), the links seamlessly blend with the surrounding text while remaining clearly clickable. The subtle underline grows and changes color on hover, giving that satisfying tactile feedback this site aims for.

For example, you might want to check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com) for a project, or read an insightful article on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com). Multiple links in a sentence work naturally—whether discussing [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), or [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Links in Different Contexts

Links work well within **bold text like [this link](https://example.com)** and also within *italicized phrases containing [a link](https://example.com)*. They maintain their styling regardless of surrounding formatting.

Here's a practical example: if you're learning web development, I'd recommend starting with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) for fundamentals, then exploring [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) for deeper dives, and keeping [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) bookmarked for browser compatibility checks.

> Even within blockquotes, links like [this reference](https://example.com) maintain their distinctive styling while respecting the quote's muted aesthetic.

## Why Styling Matters

Good link styling serves accessibility and usability. The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) recommend that links be distinguishable from surrounding text through more than just color—hence the underline that becomes more prominent on interaction.

The warm teal color (`--aero`) connects to the site's overall palette while providing sufficient contrast against the cream background. On hover, it deepens to `--pine`, and the underline thickens slightly—a small touch that makes clicking feel intentional.
