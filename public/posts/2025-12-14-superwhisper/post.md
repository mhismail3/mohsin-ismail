As we all chat more and more with LLMs and agents, I thought it time to explore some of the readily available speech-to-text tools available. I previously used [Superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com)'s free 15-minute trial on my Mac, and found it immediately useful to be able to *talk* to the Cursor window and have it type everything out with high accuracy. This weekend, I checked out [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai/) as well.

I didn't find enough differentiating features in Wispr Flow that justified the $15/month price point. But Superwhisper is terrific, at just $8.50/month. I'm highly considering purchasing the $250 lifetime license just based on my current usage and how much effort it saves.

I asked Claude to give me a quick breakdown of these two - among other things, here is the comparison table it gave^[I don't know why Claude is comparing the yearly subscription price of Superwhisper against the monthly price for Wispr Flow - Superwhisper clearly has a monthly subscription option on it's website.]:

> | | Superwhisper | Wispr Flow |
> |---|---|---|
>  **Funding** | $0 | $81M |
> | **Privacy** | Offline | Cloud-based |
> | **Customization** | High | Low |
> | **Platforms** | macOS, iOS | Mac, Windows, iOS |
> | **Price** | $85/yr or lifetime | $15/mo subscription |
> | **Target** | Power users | Mainstream + enterprise |

I love that with a single keyboard shortcut (`Option+Space` for me), Superwhisper will immediately start recording, and with another stroke it will transcribe and paste it right where your cursor is.

Also great: being able to set up custom modes with specific instructions on how to transcribe the recordings.
