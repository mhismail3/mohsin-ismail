As I find myself chatting more and more with LLMs and agents, it felt like time to explore speech-to-text tools. I'd previously tried [Superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com)'s free 15-minute trial on my Mac and found it immediately useful - being able to *talk* to Cursor and have it type everything out with high accuracy is a game-changer. This weekend, I also checked out [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai/).

Wispr Flow didn't offer enough to justify its $15/month price point. Superwhisper, on the other hand, is terrific at just $8.50/month. Based on how much I've been using it and the effort it saves, I'm seriously considering the $250 lifetime license.

I asked Claude for a quick breakdown of the two. Among other things, here's the comparison table it gave^[I'm not sure why Claude is comparing Superwhisper's yearly subscription price against Wispr Flow's monthly—Superwhisper clearly has a monthly option on its website.]:

> | | Superwhisper | Wispr Flow |
> |---|---|---|
> | **Funding** | $0 | $81M |
> | **Privacy** | Offline | Cloud-based |
> | **Customization** | High | Low |
> | **Platforms** | macOS, iOS | Mac, Windows, iOS |
> | **Price** | $85/yr or lifetime | $15/mo subscription |
> | **Target** | Power users | Mainstream + enterprise |

What I love: a single keyboard shortcut (`Option+Space` for me) immediately starts recording, and another keystroke transcribes and pastes the text right where your cursor is.

Also great is the ability to set up custom modes with specific instructions for how recordings should be transcribed.
