I've been interested in technology and software development for over 10 years, and I've been doing it professionally for the last six and a half. I currently work at Amazon on the Devices & Services Privacy Engineering team. Recently, my team and I have been supporting [Amazon's acquisition of Bee](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mariadelourdeszollo_bee-is-joining-amazon-and-we-couldnt-be-activity-7353453923795378176-zEbR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABayTsIBe2EfZX_vl21PXh5k8rQUW-MHyCA).

My key strength is my attention to detail. I'm a perfectionist, and I can obsess over the tiniest things. But I also love figuring out systems and boring details and helping everyone be more efficient.

Lately, I'm all-in on AI and figuring out what the future of all of this (especially as a developer) will be.
