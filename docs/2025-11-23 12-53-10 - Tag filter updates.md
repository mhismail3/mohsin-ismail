# Tag filter updates

- Updated hero section title to "Filter by Tag" and removed descriptive copy; the panel now only lists tags for quick filtering.
- Switched filtering to allow multi-select tags (toggle to deselect) and kept header name fixed to "Mohsin Ismail" instead of swapping to a tag.
- Tag pills now clear on re-click; clear actions renamed to "Clear tags" and shown in hero/posts sections.
- Posts header renders selected tag pills inline instead of text like "Tagged: X" for a visual, touchable filter summary.
- Context: follow-up to `2025-11-23 02-20-52 - Portfolio site setup.md`; rationale was to align UX with request for multi-tag filtering and a simplified hero.
