# Logo sizing tweak

- Reduced logo circle border thickness to 1.5px and shadow to 5px for a lighter outline similar to the reference badge.
- Increased header brand font size to clamp(1.55rem, 4.5vw, 2.2rem) so the name stands taller relative to the mark.
- Context: visual polish request to balance the logo and title proportions.
