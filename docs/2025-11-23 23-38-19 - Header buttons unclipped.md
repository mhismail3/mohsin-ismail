# Header buttons unclipped

- Allowed the sticky header to render overflow while keeping the animated nav height intact, so Portfolio/About buttons (and their shadows) are no longer clipped at the bottom.
- Let the expanded nav state expose overflow to show full button styling without increasing the container’s height.
