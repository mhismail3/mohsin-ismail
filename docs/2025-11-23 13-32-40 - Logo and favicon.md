# Logo and favicon

- Updated page title to "Mohsin Ismail" and set document title on load.
- Added circular logo mark next to the header name with drop-shadowed border styled to match the provided reference; image sourced from `src/assets/mohsin.png`.
- Programmatically set favicon to the same logo (handles hashed asset/base path) and adjusted brand layout to align mark + name.
- Context: implements branding request using the supplied `mohsin.PNG` image while keeping the retro tactile styling.
