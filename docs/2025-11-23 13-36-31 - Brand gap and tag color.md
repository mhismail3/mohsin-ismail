# Brand gap and tag color

- Increased spacing between logo mark and header text for breathing room.
- Forced tag pills to use brand ink color (and pine when active), adding `color` + `-webkit-text-fill-color` to avoid Safari blue text; kept the reduced sizing.
- Context: visual tweak requested for header mark balance and consistent tag color on iOS Safari.
