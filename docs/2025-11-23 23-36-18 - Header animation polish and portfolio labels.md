# Header animation polish and portfolio labels

- Removed fixed max-heights on the sticky header; the nav now auto-sizes with a measured top-menu height for smoother expand/collapse and no extra blank space beneath.
- Replaced the caret text with SVG ellipsis/chevron icons on the toggle button for a cleaner look while retaining existing button styles.
- Refined top-menu animation with max-height/opacity/translate transitions to eliminate jitter on both desktop and mobile.
- Updated portfolio title pills to a rounded rectangle without border/shadow, kept the blurred backdrop, and switched to the header serif font for consistency.
