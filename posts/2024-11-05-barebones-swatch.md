Quick palette recap for fast prototyping:

- Cream `#f8f3e8` for the main canvas.
- Ink `#1f1a14` for borders and type.
- Aero `#2c8f7a` for primary actions with Pine `#0f7363` on hover.
- Clay `#c45b37` for errors and warm highlights.

It keeps the retro-futuristic editorial vibe intact even in bare sketches.
