This drop ships the core styling primitives for my projects:

- Color tokens for cream, ink, line, muted, aero, pine, and clay.
- A "press" model that steps shadows from `4px → 2px → 0px` on hover/active.
- Glass panels with soft drop shadows and dashed inner borders for structure.

Everything is mobile-first and comes with Newsreader + DM Serif Display baked in. It’s the same kit used on this site.
