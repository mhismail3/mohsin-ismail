summary: "Adopted write-once documentation so updates are append-only with clear rationale."
---

Moved all project notes into a write-once docs folder. Updates are new files that reference the prior version, which keeps history intact and makes handoffs easier for new agents.

The format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS - Topic.md` with system time converted from the local clock. It’s lightweight and keeps context chronological.
