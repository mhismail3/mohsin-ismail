summary: "Started designs mobile-first, tightened spacing, and tuned transitions for thumb reach."

I rebuilt the landing experience starting with a 360px-wide viewport:

- Buttons get larger hit targets but lighter padding to keep density.
- Panels collapse into a single column with consistent gutters.
- Typography scales down but keeps the serif hierarchy intact.

The goal: read comfortably on transit without zooming.
